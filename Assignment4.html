<h2>1.4 Failure Predictions</h2>
<h3>1.4.1. Chair</h3>
<img src="output/failure_gt_cls_0.gif" alt="Visualization 1">
<img src="output/failure_pred_cls_0.gif" alt="Visualization 2">

<p>Interpretation: It is able to predict ladder as a chair all because of it's 4 legs as seen in the model
    However, the ladder belongs to a different class and due to similar features like the legs of the chair
    It considers the object as a chair and not like a ladder.

<h3>1.4.2.Vase</h3>
<img src="output/failure_gt_cls_1.gif" alt="Visualization 1">
<img src="output/failure_pred_cls_1.gif" alt="Visualization 2">
<p>Interpretation: The vase presented as table cot may be due to the reason of points placed in a particular sequence 
    just as table and this is turning the prediction towards table as vase.
</p>

<h3>1.4.3. Lamp</h3>
<img src="output/failure_gt_cls_2.gif" alt="Lamp Failure">
<img src="output/failure_pred_cls_2.gif" alt="Lamp Failure">
<p>Interpretation: It considers globe as lamp since due to the quite similar similar shapes or appearance from certain viewpoints.
    Thus, it misclassifies these instances where the distinguishing features are not prominent across classes.

<h2>2.3 Interpretation</h2>
<p> A segmentation model, loads a pre-trained checkpoint, and evaluates 
    its performance on
    randomly selected objects from a test dataset.
    For each object, it selects a subset of points, makes predictions, 
    calculates accuracy, and visualizes the segmentation results in terms 
    of ground truth and predicted labels. 
    The accuracy metrics demonstrate the model's effectiveness in segmenting 
    objects from the point cloud data, and the visualization provides insights
    into the segmentation quality for each selected object. The random selection 
    of objects allows for a diverse assessment of the model's generalization capabilities.</p>

<h1>3. Robustness Analysis</h1>
<h2>3.1. Describe the Procedure</h2>
<p>
1. Loading the labeled data (test_label and test_data)<br>
2. Initializing the segmentation and classification model<br>
3. Loading the pre-trained model checkpoint from a specified path for both segmentation and classification models<br>
4. Defining the rotate_point_cloud function to rotate the input point cloud by a specified angle (30 degrees in this case) for both classification and segmentation<br>
5. Creating visualization directories<br>
6. Rotating and predicting after rotating the dataset by 30 degrees using the rotate_point_cloud function<br>
7. Obtaining model predictions for every batch<br>
8. Visualizing ground truth, predicted segmentation, and classification results and saving them<br>
9. Computing test accuracy based on the predicted labels and ground truth labels<br>

<h2>3.3. Comparison</h2>
<p>

<h3>Classification Task:</h3>
In a classification task, the goal is to assign a single label to the entire input<br>
point cloud. Therefore, the colors in the visualization represent the predicted class <br>
labels for the entire object. Since each object is assigned a single label, all parts <br>
of the object are visualized with the same color. The goal is to determine the overall<br>
category of the object rather than identifying specific parts

<h3>Segmentation Task:</h3>
In a segmentation task, the goal is to assign a label to each point in the input point<br>
cloud, effectively segmenting the object into different parts. In the visualization, <br>
different colors are used to represent different segmented parts of the object. This <br>
allows for a more detailed understanding of the object's structure, <br>
as each color corresponds to a specific segment or part.<br>


Classification: If the classification results show similar colors for the entire object,<br>
it indicates that the model is focusing on the overall category or class of the object.<br>


Segmentation: If the segmentation results show variations in colors for different parts of <br>
the object, it suggests that the model is successfully segmenting the object into 
distinct regions or components.
</p>

<h2>3.4 Interpretation</h2>
<p> The classification results, as visualized in the provided code, show objects with uniform
    colors, indicating that the model is successfully assigning overall class labels to the<br>
    entire point clouds. In contrast, the segmentation results exhibit a rich variety of colors,<br>
    signifying the model's ability to discern and categorize different parts of the objects. <br>
    This distinction underscores the nature of each task: classification focuses on identifying<br>
    the general category of an object, while segmentation delves into the detailed recognition<br>
    of individual components within the object. The visualizations thus align with the inherent <br>
    objectives and outcomes of classification and segmentation tasks in point cloud analysis.</p>
